/**
 * Per-intent tool scoping — the fix for "the assistant ignores the tools and
 * bluffs".
 *
 * ## The measured defect
 *
 * The model does NOT lack judgement. Probed live with the real provider:
 *
 * | catalogue | question | tools the model picked |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 2 tools | «هل يوجد أمر شراء P26E11407؟» | `lookup_document` ✅ |
 * | 28 tools | «اكتر بند اتكرر في أوامر شراء EDC من الميل info» | `search_database`, `learn_organization`, `aggregate_customer_po_items` — **never `scan_email_items`** ❌ |
 * | 28 tools | «كم عدد الموردين؟» | `count_database`, `system_overview`, `run_readonly_query` ✅ |
 *
 * The same model with the same prompt chose correctly from a small catalogue and
 * chose *plausible-but-wrong* tools from a large one. That is catalogue
 * overload — and it explains the recorded behaviour precisely: it reaches for
 * `cancel_job` / `job_status` / `resend_job_report` on a data question, or
 * answers with no tool call at all, because it cannot hold 28 tool contracts in
 * view while reasoning about the question.
 *
 * Scoping is not a hint. The prompts already described the correct tool and were
 * ignored, so the WRONG tools are REMOVED from the catalogue rather than
 * discouraged in prose. The router is deterministic, free and already unit-tested
 * — this turns its output into an actual constraint.
 *
 * ## Why not merely lower MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS
 *
 * The rounds budget limits how many times the model may call a tool; it does not
 * change WHICH tool it picks. The wrong tool was chosen on round 1.
